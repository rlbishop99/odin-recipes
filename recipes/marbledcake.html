    <p>This is regular freaking cake but with marbles in it. Ever heard of russian roulette?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One box of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Betty-Crocker-Super-French-Vanilla/dp/B00XMYUJ3O" target="_blank">

        <li>Marbles. LOTS of marbles.</li>
        <li>Paintball Gun? (x1)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake the vanilla cake with lots of love, using the instructions on the box.</li>
        <li>Ignore the sounds of marbles being loaded into the paintball gun.</li>
        <li>Burst into tears as your son demolishes the cake with marbles he's shooting
            from the paintball gun.</li>
        <li>Try and enjoy the remaining scraps of the cake you worked so hard to bake,
            as your delinquent son giggles to himself in the background.</li>
